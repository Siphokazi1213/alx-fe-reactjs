Creating my first React App

Created an empty repository called alx-fe-reactjs

Cloned the repository and cd into that directory.

Ran the command npm created vite@latest alx-react-app -- --template react where alx-react-app is the name of my react app.

To see what my app looked like, I cd into the alx-react-app directory that was created and run the command npm install.

Lastly, I ran the command npm run dev.
