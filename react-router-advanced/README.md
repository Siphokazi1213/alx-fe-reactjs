# Advanced Routing in React with React Router

This project demonstrates the implementation of advanced routing techniques using **React Router**, including nested, dynamic, and protected routes.

## Features

- **Nested Routes:** The `/profile` route has nested children (`/details` and `/settings`) that are rendered within the parent component.
- **Dynamic Routing:** The `/post/:postId` route dynamically displays content based on the `postId` parameter in the URL.
- **Protected Routes:** The `/dashboard` route is protected, requiring users to log in before they can access it.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:** `git clone alx-fe-reactjs`
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:** `cd react-router-advanced`
3.  **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
4.  **Run the application:** `npm run dev`

The application will launch in your browser. Use the navigation links to explore the different routing features. To access the protected dashboard, use 'user' as the username and 'password' as the password on the login page.
